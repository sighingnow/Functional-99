    Count the leaves of a binary tree
    A leaf is a node with no successors. Write a predicate count_leaves/2 to count them.
    
    Example:
    % count_leaves(T,N) :‐ the binary tree T has N leaves
    Example in Haskell:
    > countLeaves tree4
    2
 --}

data Tree a = Empty | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show, Eq)

tree4 = Branch 1 (Branch 2 Empty (Branch 4 Empty Empty)) (Branch 2 Empty Empty)

countLeaves :: Tree a -> Int
countLeaves Empty = 0
countLeaves (Branch _ Empty Empty) = 1
countLeaves (Branch _ l r) = countLeaves l + countLeaves r
