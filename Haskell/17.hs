(*) Split a list into two partsÍ¾ the length of the first part is given.
    Do not use any predefined predicates.

    Example:
    * (split '(a b c d e f g h i k) 3)
    ( (A B C) (D E F G H I K))

    Example in Haskell:
    *Main> split "abcdefghik" 3
    ("abc", "defghik")
 --}

split :: [a] -> Int -> ([a], [a])
split xs n = (take n xs, drop n xs)
